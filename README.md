# EasyBank
Front-end Mentor EasyBank Landing Page Project

Using the guidance of the Coder Coder tutorial and various othr resources, I created a responsive, front-end website using front-end mentor's files.
This took about 10 hours to build as this is my first ever website creation.

Breakpoints were used to dynamically readjust the website for mobile, tablet and desktop.

I learned so much from this experience and can now say that I have CSS, HTML and Javascript under my belt, as well as SASS and live server on VS code.
